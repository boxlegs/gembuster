## Gembuster - Enumerating the Small Web
I'm a big fan of the {dir,go,ferox}buster tools. I love them. They work a treat. And for all its faults, I'm also interested in the Gemini protocol. This is a directory busting tool for Gemini servers written in **Go**. It has the basic functionality of other *buster tools and is (as far as I know) the first of its kind. The syntax and usage is near-identical to other tools.

```sh
gembuster -u geminiserver.com -w raft-common-directories-blah.txt
```
